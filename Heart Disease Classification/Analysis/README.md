# **Predictive Modeling of Cardiovascular Disease Using Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers**

This project focuses on employed multiple machine learning models for heart disease classification. It employs Logistic Regression, and KNeighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost Classifier for classification tasks.

## **Introduction**

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Importing required libraries**
2. **Loading the dataset and performing an overview**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling null values
   - Handling duplicate values
   - Handling outliers
   - Design Data Scalling Pipelines 
5. **Machine learning model training and evaluation**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - KNeighbors Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine
   - XGBoost Classifier
7. **Model Comparison**: The performance of each regression model is evaluated using the following evaluation metrics:
   - Classification Report 
   - Confusion Matrix 
   - F1 Score
   - Roc Curve
   - Precision Recall Curve
8. **Feature Importance**

## **Instructions**

## **To run the analysis:**

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the provided Python code in your preferred Python environment.
4. Load the dataset (assuming it's named "heart.csv") into your working directory.

## **File Structure**

- `heart.csv`: Dataset containing heart disease data.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, steps performed, and instructions for running the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file containing a list of Python packages required to run the code.
- `project-code.ipynb`: Contains the code for data preprocessing and analysis.

## **Notes**

- Modify the code and analyses as needed based on specific requirements or dataset characteristics.
- Ensure that all required libraries are installed before running the code.
